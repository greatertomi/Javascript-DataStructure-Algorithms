    // Write a function called isSubsequence which takes in two strings and checks
    // whether the characters in the first string form a subsequence of the characters
    // in the second string. In other words, the function should check whether the characters
    // in the first string appear somewhere in the second string, without their order changing.

    // Time Complexity - O(N + M)
    // Space Complexity - O(1)
